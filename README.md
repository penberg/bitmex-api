# BitMEX API for C++

This is an client implementation of the BitMEX API for C++.
The library is transport-agnostic so you need a WebSocket library, such as [WebSocket++](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp) for a working solution.
Please see the [example application](examples/monitor.cpp) for more information.
